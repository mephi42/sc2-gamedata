# sc2-gamedata
Pre-exported optimal JSON StarCraft 2 game data for AI bot usage and some terrible, terrible code used to generate it.

Uses TinyXML2, JsonCpp & boost, plus you need to extract all .sc2mod directories from your game installation, and stableid.json from your personal Documents\StarCraft II directory.
